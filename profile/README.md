# Leaf 
Leaf aims to be "Light as a leaf". A very light weight, but powerful kernel.

## Architecture Support
| Architecture 	| Status 	|
|--------------	|--------	|
| x86-64       	| ✅      |
| x86          	| ❌      |

We are planning on making our own x86 bootloader to add some support for 32bit. But currently we are only using the limine bootloader (for x86_64)
